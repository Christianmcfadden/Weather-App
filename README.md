# Weather-App
This program uses a API to give users weather forecasts for their local area. Languages: Python Flask(HTML, CSS) Bootstrap SQLite

A user is allowed to create a login personalize their dashboard and view different profiles. This projects has a social side to it where users can post about the weather conditions they are experiencing. Login credentials are encrypted and secure. I am still working on the security of the database as we decided to use sqlite for production purposes.
